            Our Common Share™ OCS™, a revolutionary new system of social media,
            along with community managed governance, and a currency token for
            its market systems, built on Custom Blockchain technology.

            Traditional social networking is a system of information shared by
            users that is used by the centralized platforms to drive traffic to
            links that can increase profits, along with background data
            collection. This raises issues regarding privacy, ownership of
            information, and protection of data, that privately owned,
            centralized systems, are not managing in a manner that respects
            users rights to privacy.

            By using a combination of machine learning and human verification
            advertising, clickbait, malware, and the minefield of other junk can
            be mitigated. Our Community Advertising Committee will be a human
            verification system, that examines ads by thoroughly verifying their
            content, legitimacy,and other metrics. In other words, it shields
            OCS™ from invasive advertising, fake news and much more. There is no
            system that beats a human verification process. Ads will have to
            comply with community standards.

            Data traditionally mined from the platform user will be shown to the
            user and the user can decide what they want to share, if anything.
            There will be the option to monetize this data, but it will not be
            on by default. This gives members a chance to learn about privacy,
            and data management before activation.

            Together with the people of this world we can, and will build
            transparent social media, a real community, of actual people, and
            take back control to the user. No more big business directing the
            narrative, or politics. The people will be the voice of change, you
            have the power to simply sign up and use this powerful new platform
            to get more involved in the direction of OCS™, that puts the real
            power of change into the hands of the people! We realize this new
            direction is needed in our social media systems.

            Companies joining the platform, user created or existing will apply
            to community for licence to create their space in OCS™, a panel of
            community members will score the company on a few different metrics,
            such as, community involvement, employee satisfaction, environmental
            stewardship, and other metrics the community decides are relevant in
            the process. A vote will be held and the company will be granted
            space on the platform, their score average displayed, this score
            will be a link to the breakdown of score across categories, and a
            forum the company can use to work with the OCS™ community to get
            that score to 100% OCS™ will create a environment where people will
            truly have a choice, a vote, a share, and most importantly, a voice!
